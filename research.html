                On a superficial account, the brain contributes to the adaptive
                success of animals through the control and coordination of
                effector organs like muscles. Survival of an animal requires the
                timing of effector activation to bear some relation to purpose:
                “An animal must contract its jaw muscles when its jaw contains
                something worth biting and contract its leg muscles when there
                is something worth running to or away from.”

              <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.2em">
                However, as the environment that animals interact with becomes
                more complex, the decision for current action very often depends
                on past sensory information no longer present to the animal.
                Foraging rodents need to remember which patches were already
                searched to save energy, and humans need to remember where to
                reach their fingers each morning for their car keys. Both humans
                and animals demonstrate the ability to use past experiences to
                plan and simulate future actions, which are important
                characteristics for higher order brain function and complex
                decision making.

                My work at Lee Lab as a research assistant models these tasks to
                study memory recall and imagination in the rodent model system.
                We train mice and rats to perform spatial navigation tasks that
                require them to either actively recall past experiences or
                imagine possible future scenarios. During behavior, we record
                from them using multisite silicon probes and population calcium
                imaging. The data we collect is then interpreted with an array
                of methods simple and complex, including anything from firing
                rate analysis to RNN-based experiment variable decoders.

                My current project uses a T-maze based DNMTS (delayed
                nonmatch-to-sample) task to study how working memory information
                is maintained through long delay period in rodents. The task
                requires the subject to remember a sample stimulus over a long
                delay and then choose a novel nonmatching option when presented
                with the sample and a new alternative. In the T-maze setting,
                both sample stimulus and the new alternative are navigation
                targets equipped with reward ports. We record from free moving
                animals during experiment to obtain large-scale
                electrophysiological data, and we look for reliable patterns
                that appear consistently during delay period that signals the
                sample stimulus.

                An interesting method that I’ve implemented for the analysis
                uses a LSTM-based decoder architecture and a special loss
                objective that classifies the animal’s location while
                differentiating the spatial geometries of different
                classification target. This makes the model aware of the
                consequences of different classification errors that reflect the
                spatial geometry of the maze’s layout. The model was able to
                improve by 2.4 times on evaluation metrics and converge faster
                in training, which is helping us to both detect representation
                of future navigation goals and past navigational experience in
                mice.
