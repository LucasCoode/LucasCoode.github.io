                The brain’s fundamental role in adaptive behavior lies in its
                capacity to coordinate effector organs in response to
                environmental demands. The timing of muscle activations, for
                example, can drastically affect behavioral outcomes in classic
                fight or flight contexts. However, as the environment becomes
                more complex, the decision for immediate action often relies on
                past sensory states no longer present to the animal. Foraging
                rodents need to remember which patches were already searched to
                conserve energy, and humans need to remember where they last
                placed their car keys. Both humans and animals demonstrate the
                ability to use past experiences to plan and simulate future
                actions, which are essential characteristics for higher-order
                brain function and flexible decision-making.

                >My work at Lee Lab models these tasks to study memory recall
                and imagination in the rodent model system. We train mice and
                rats to perform spatial navigation tasks that require them to
                either actively recall past experiences or imagine potential
                future trajectories. During behavior, we record from them using
                multisite silicon probes and population calcium imaging methods.
                With our group’s strong background in engineering and
                mathematics, we apply a range of analytical approaches from
                simple firing-rate analysis to RNN-based experiment variable
                decoders.

                My current project employs a T-maze-based DNMTS (delayed
                nonmatch-to-sample) task to study how working memory is
                maintained through long delay periods in rodents. The task
                requires the subject to remember a sample stimulus over a long
                delay and then choose a novel nonmatching option when presented
                with the sample and the new alternative. In the T-maze
                implementation, both the sample stimulus and the new alternative
                are navigation targets equipped with reward ports. We record
                large-scale electrophysiological activity in freely moving
                animals and examine consistent patterns that emerge during delay
                as signatures of the maintained sample stimulus.

                To analyze high-dimensional neural population data, I developed
                a novel LSTM (long short-term memory) decoder incorporating a
                custom loss function termed GICEL (Geometry-Informed
                Cross-Entropy Loss). This architecture processes population
                vector trajectories to classify animal location, task phase, and
                movement direction with a few technical innovations.
                Feature-gating mechanisms in early layers help to selectively
                emphasize informative neural signals (e.g., place cell activity)
                while suppressing noise from less relevant cell types.
                Additionally, the vanishing gradient tendency of LSTM, which is
                traditionally a limitation of RNN architectures, is leveraged to
                naturally prioritize more recent PVs in the sequence over
                earlier ones. The custom loss function, GICEL, further enhances
                performance by making the model aware of the consequences of
                different classification errors that reflect the maze’s spatial
                geometry. Unlike conventional cross-entropy loss that optimizes
                based solely on the target class probability, GICEL incorporates
                information from the entire prediction distribution. These
                technical designs achieved a 2.4-fold improvement in evaluation
                metrics and accelerated training convergence compared to
                standard methods.

                I am currently applying the model to both delay phase data and
                task phase data to detect nonlocal representations: population
                activity patterns that do not reflect the animal’s immediate
                sensory state. During the delay period, we search for
                representations of either recently visited locations
                (retrospective coding) or future goal locations (prospective
                planning). During task execution, we track the emergence of
                target location representations to identify the moment of
                decision commitment. This work is ongoing and continues to
                provide insights into the neural dynamics of working memory and
                decision-making. Complementing this empirical work, I am
                developing reinforcement learning simulations of the behavioral
                task to generate testable predictions about the computational
                demands of working memory maintenance (see the Simulation page

                viral tracing methodologies to investigate the connectivity of
                the STN (subthalamic nucleus). The basal ganglia circuit is
                highly recurrent with very specialized input-output
                relationships. STN occupies a strategic position within the
                basal ganglia circuit as the primary modulator of basal ganglia
                output and a critical target for basal ganglia DBS (deep brain
                stimulation) therapeutics. In our literature review, we found
                that previous studies of STN afferent projections using chemical
                tracers were prone to inconsistent results, where retrogradely
                labeled regions failed to demonstrate reciprocal connectivity
                when examined with anterograde chemical tracers.</span

                construct known as TRIO (Tracing the Relationship between Input
                and Output), targeting STN and its main postsynaptic target SNr
                (substantia nigra pars reticulata). This system integrates a
                clever combination of a modified viral vector with the Cre
                expression system to restrict the expression of the fluorescence
                reporter to a specific path of projection. The approach enables
                precise trans-synaptic input mapping from defined neuronal
                populations based on both projection targets and cell-type
                identity, attenuating false-positive signals from injection site

                >In the end, our results helped address the inconsistencies in
                the existing literature and additionally identified novel
                anatomical connections to the STN that had not been previously
                characterized. We also found initial evidence of internal
                topographical organization in several key structures, including
                GPe (globus pallidus external segment) and caudoputamen.
                Specifically, anatomically adjacent regions within these
                structures exhibited distinct connectivity patterns, suggesting
                functional subdivision at a finer spatial scale than previously
                appreciated. These results contribute to our current models of
                basal ganglia organization and have implications for
                understanding both normal circuit function and the mechanisms
                underlying movement disorders. These findings were presented in

                miniature teleost fish species is a close relative of zebrafish
                that not only remains transparent throughout its lifetime but
                also lacks a skull roof, making it an attractive model for
                optical neuroimaging studies of intact brain circuits. My
                undergraduate research experience encompassed three
                complementary projects investigating their social behavior,
                developmental neuroanatomy, and sensory system

                we hoped to establish behavioral paradigms for intraspecific
                aggression. During aggressive displays, males exhibit a
                stereotyped behavioral pattern including hypertrophied jaw
                extension and coordinated acoustic signaling. We analyzed the
                interactions between Danionella adult males to score how often
                an individual directed or received aggression from another male.
                We were able to demonstrate that Danionella exhibits a
                sophisticated hierarchical social relationship in which
                aggressive “higher-ranking” individuals receive less aggression
                and gain more frequent access to spawning sites than
                “lower-ranking,” less aggressive conspecifics.

                trajectories of different brain regions in Danionella dracula
                using advanced optical methods. Working with Dr. Rose Tatarsky,
                we employed three-photon microscopy to perform comprehensive
                volumetric imaging of the entire central nervous system in
                intact, living Danionella specimens. This approach required no
                physical intervention other than simple mechanical
                stabilization, which allows for longitudinal studies of nervous
                system development. We identified the boundary between different
                brain regions in 3P imaging data using established
                neuroanatomical landmarks. This then enabled us to track
                regional growth trajectories with contour tracing and volumetric
                estimation methodologies. A particularly interesting result we
                were able to demonstrate was that the emergence of behavioral
                patterns like the aggressive displays correlates with the rapid
                growth of certain brain regions, providing quantitative evidence

                Danionella dracula telencephalon to construct a sensory map for
                the Danionella brain, relying on the fact that sensory
                representation is often topographically organized in teleost
                sensory systems. I was initially contributing to viral vector
                injection protocols that aimed at establishing transgenic lines
                expressing pan-neuronal GCaMP. However, achieving uniform
                expression across diverse brain regions presented significant
                technical challenges that could confound activity measurements.
                To circumvent this limitation, we adopted an alternative
                endogenous activity marker known as pERK (phosphorylated
                extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Previous studies in
                larval zebrafish demonstrated robust correlations between pERK
                expression levels and GCaMP-derived activity measurements,
                validating this approach for our application. Through systematic
                pERK immunohistochemistry following controlled sensory
                stimulation (visual, acoustic, and lateral line modalities), we
                identified discrete telencephalic regions responsive to each
                sensory domain, contributing to the first comprehensive sensory
                map for this emerging model system.</span

                was involved in research projects on very diverse topics,

                >At Sichuan University, I investigated how metformin, a widely
                prescribed antidiabetic medication with a nuanced profile of
                therapeutic benefits, affects the nervous system repair of a
                highly regenerative flatworm species called planaria. With a
                team of three high school researchers, we conducted controlled
                experiments exposing planarian populations to graded metformin
                concentrations and quantified neural repair responses using
                immunohistochemical visualization. To further explore
                metformin’s operating mechanism, we consulted literature and
                identified the GSK3β/Wnt signaling pathway as a potential
                mediator of metformin's regenerative effects. To test this
                hypothesis, we implemented pharmacological pathway inhibition
                experiments and demonstrated metformin's neural repair
                enhancement is abolished when GSK3β/Wnt signaling is blocked.
                This evidence suggests that GSK3β/Wnt plays a major role in
                metformin-mediated neural regeneration.</span

                >In the Emei Mountains, the habitat of the Rana Daunchina frog,
                I assisted two graduate students in investigating the species’
                courtship behavior. The research project employed controlled
                playback experiments to determine female preferences for
                specific male call characteristics and examine the evolutionary
                pressures shaping acoustic communication. To ensure the
                experiments coincided with the species’ natural mating period, I
                adopted a nocturnal cycle. I captured the frogs for use in the
                experiments each morning before I went to sleep, and I woke up
                in the late afternoon to prepare for the experiments at
                midnight. Our results showed that not only are the females
                highly selective in their mating call preference, the structure
                of male-built nests changes the male’s mating call acoustically
                to match the female’s preferred frequency profile.</span

                research expedition as a volunteer with the National Department
                of Biology. The purpose of the trip was to analyze how local
                animal populations had changed their navigation patterns and
                spatial distribution in response to local tourist activities. We
                used mapping software to survey how the population distribution
                of indicator species like reptiles and snakes had changed due to
                human constructions. In parallel, we installed infrared cameras
                to trace keystone species like the local takin population, a
                gentle animal that looks like a sheep with a buffalo head. Our
                comprehensive analysis provided park officials with quantitative
                data on habitat fragmentation effects and population
                displacement patterns. These results were used to inform park
                management decisions regarding protective barrier placement and
                tourism-impact mitigation strategies.</span
