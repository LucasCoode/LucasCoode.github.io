              A way that the brain contributes to the adaptive success of
              animals through the control and coordination of muscle
              contractions. Survival of an animal requires the timing of muscle
              contraction to bear some relation to purpose: “An animal must
              contract its jaw muscles when its jaw contains something worth
              biting and contract its leg muscles when there is something worth
              running to or away from”.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              However, as the environment that animals deal with becomes more
              complex, it very so often happens that the decision for current
              muscle movements depend on past sensory information no longer
              present to the animal. Foraging rodents need to remember which
              patches were already searched to save energy, and humans need to
              remember where to reach their fingers each morning for their car
              keys. Both humans and animals demonstrate the ability to use past
              experiences to plan and simulate future actions, which are
              important characteristics for higher order brain function and
              complex decision making.

              My work at Lee Lab as a research assistant models these tasks to
              study memory recall and imagination in rodent model system with
              spatial navigation paradigm. We train mice and rats to perform
              spatial navigation tasks that require them to recall past
              experiences or actively imagine possible future scenarios. We
              obtain a high temporal resolution read out of the trajectory of
              their brain states using electrophysiological techniques, which we
              then use machine learning and statistical methods to interpret. My
              project in the lab uses a T-maze based delayed nonmatch-to-sample
              navigation tasks to study how working memory is maintained on a
              long behavioral time scale.
