                Rock climbing is my passion. It's what grounds me when research
                hits roadblocks or coursework becomes overwhelming. I started
                climbing in college and now enjoy bouldering, top-roping, and
                lead climbing across the Northeast. My long-standing nemesis
                remains "Andrew's Problem" at the Gunks in upstate New York—a
                humbling reminder that some problems take time.

                Since moving to Boston, I've been climbing with the local
                community at Rumney, Ross Pond, and Lincoln Woods. Through their
                mentorship, I've learned anchor building, multi-pitch systems,
                and rope rescue techniques. I am grateful for these learning
                opportunities and look forward to returning the favor as an
                instructor someday.

                Running provides clarity when everything else feels chaotic. To
                me, running is one of the few things in life where the reward
                always matches the effort you put in. It reminds me of the value
                of hard work during my more challenging times.

                Over the years, I've run a dozen half-marathons and three
                marathons (San Francisco, Philadelphia, Burlington). I’m not a
                fast runner, but I’ve noticed small, steady improvements each
                time I reach the finish line. My dream is to qualify for and run
                the Boston Marathon with a sub-2:45 finish, which requires me to
                be 30% faster than my current best pace.

                FPV (First-Person View) drone racing is a sport where pilots fly
                small, agile quadcopters at high speeds using live video feed
                displayed on goggles. It delivers the intensity of Formula 1
                racing without putting pilots at risk during high-speed crashes.
                The same technology has been scaled up by the film industry to
                capture motor sports and movie chase scenes.

                As is common in this hobby, I build my drones from commercially
                available modular components: carbon fiber frames, brushless
                motors, flight controls, and analog video transmitters. It's a
                hands-on mix of electrical engineering, basic aerodynamics, and
                precision flight control. Unfortunately, crash repair can be a
                pain since most materials, even carbon fiber, break at such high
                impact speeds. Apart from amateur racing, I also fly
                recreationally at hobbyist air fields and in open forest areas.

                When I received the research scholarship from UCLA, I invested
                part of it in my first personal camera: a Canon R8 with a
                versatile second-hand zoom lens (RF 24-105mm). Since then, I've
                captured landscapes in Utah's national parks, wildlife during
                winter hikes in the White Mountains, portraits at my college
                graduation, and the vast wilderness of Alaska. I shoot
                landscapes, wildlife, and portraits—occasionally saving my

                As a researcher in neuroscience, I'm fascinated by how a single
                photograph can trigger such vivid memory retrieval. Visual
                stimuli robustly engage hippocampal circuits, facilitating
                pattern completion and content-addressable memory. These images
                help me relive not just what I saw, but the full sensory
                experience of each moment before pressing the shutter—the cold
                mountain air, the anticipation of the shot, the feeling of being
                fully present. Those memories are now part of me, and my
                circuits.
