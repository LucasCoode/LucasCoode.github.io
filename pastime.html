                Rock climbing is my passion. It's what grounds me when research
                hits roadblocks or coursework becomes overwhelming. I started
                climbing as a freshman in college and now enjoy bouldering,
                toproping, and lead climbing. My nemesis boulder problem is
                "Andrew's Problem V4" at the Gunks in upstate New York.

                At Boston, I've been climbing with the local climbing community
                at outdoor locations including Rumney, Ross Pond, and Lincoln
                Wood. I've learned anchor building, multi-pitch climbing, and
                rope rescue skills. I am grateful for the local climbing
                communities' mentorship and hope to give back as a instructor
                myself one day.

                It takes an idiot to run a marathon, and I am not afraid to be
                one. To me, running is the rare thing in life where how much
                reward you get is exactly how much effort you give. Like rock
                climbing, it grounds me and remind me of the value of hard work
                in my harder times.

                I've ran a dozen half marathons and a total of 3 marathons so
                far (San Francisco, Philadelphia, Burlington). I am not a fast
                runner, but emperical evidence sugguests that I am always making
                it to the end and always getting a little faster. My current
                next event is Newport Marathon(Oct 12 2025). My dream is to
                qualify for and run the Boston Marathon with a sub 2h55min
                finish, which requires me to be 30% faster than my current best
                pace.

                FPV (First-Person View) drone racing is a sport where pilots fly
                small, agile quadcopters at high speeds using live video feed
                displayed on goggles. It's a speed race that is all as intense
                as Formula-1 but doesn't put the pilot in the danger of
                high-speed crashes. Scaled-up version of FPV drones are used by
                the industry to film motor sports and movie chase scenes.
              </p>
              <p class="pastime-description">
                As common for FPV pilots, I build my drones from
                commercially-available modular components: carbon fiber frame,
                brushless motors, flight control, analog video transmitter...
                It's a hands-on mix of electrical engineering, basic
                aerodynamics, and fine flight control. Unfortunately, crash
                repair can be a pain since most material breaks at such high
                compact speed. Apart from amateur racing, I also fly
                recreationally at hobbist air fields and in the forests.

                with a versatile second-hand zoom lens (RF 24-105). I am in

                Each moment, the sensory information we receive is incredibly
                high-dimensional, yet visual stimuli alone can robustly engage
                hippocampal circuits, facilitating pattern completion and
                content-addressable memory retrieval. These pictures help me
                re-live each moment behind my camera right before I press for
                shutter, for that memory is now a part of me.

                My <strong>most consistent</strong> hobby that I started doing
                since childhood. In fact, depending on the hour you are reading
                this, I might be practicing it right now!
